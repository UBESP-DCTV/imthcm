    which are stored in `data/`.
* Updated `hm.R`.


# imtchm 0.0.7.2

* Updated `hm.R`


# imtchm 0.0.7

* Minor update to documentations.
* Added `health_to_xml.R` and `xml_to_health` to convert health historical
    data frame from/to xml format.

    historical data frame from/to xml format.


# imtchm 0.0.6

* Minor update to documentations.
* Renamed `predict_event.R` in `predict_hm` as the provided function.
* Updated `inst/modules/hm.R`.
* Added `prediction_to_xml.R` to convert and write prediction to XML file.


# imtchm 0.0.5

* Updated test and default datased and models.
* Added `predict_event.R` to comput the predictions.
* Removed `dd` variable in the preprocessing and in themodel and included
    interaction between its component (with `dd` no future-prediction were
    possible because levels for future year were not present).


# imtchm 0.0.4

* Improved function to preprocess data, changing its name from `pre_proc.R`
    to `weather_preproc.R`.

    masked).
* Updated documentation on datasets.
* Added `train_event_models.R` to train the models.
