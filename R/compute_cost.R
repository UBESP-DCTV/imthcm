#' Compute costs of related health events
#'
#' This function computes the costs associated the cardiac and respiratory
#' hospitalizations. Individual available costs were associated to stroke
#' occurrence and Congenital Hearth Diseases (CHD) for cardiac events,
#' whereas they were associated to Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
#' (COPD).
#'
#' Costs for Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) and stroke were derived from the
#' report of the American Heart Association (1) (which reported data on
#' costs derived from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) of the
#' U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality), considering 2015 data.
#' Unitary costs (medical, indirect, and total) have been calculated by
#' dividing the projected number of CHD and strokes by the corresponding
#' projected costs (for 2015).
#'
#' Costs for COPD were derived from the paper of Fen et al (2). They were
#' represented only by medical costs and referred to the year 2010. Also
#' COPD costs reported in the paper were derived from the MEPS survey.
#' Cost estimates are based on an exchange rate EUR-USD of 1.233.
#'
#' The output of the function is a data frame. The data frame is composed
#' by simulated days: n rows and 6 columns. Each row gives the fitted
#' number, with relative 95% CI, of the considered health outcomes and
#' relavite costs. Each column represents respectively the date of the
#' simulated day, the health outcomes, the 95% CI lower bound of the
#' predicted average daily number of events, the predicted average daily
#' number of events and the the 95% CI upper bound of the predicted average
#' daily number of events, the 95% CI lower bound of costs associated to a
#' particular health events, the average daily costs associated to a
#' particular health event and the 95% CI upper bound of costs associated
#' to a particular health events.
#'
#'
#' @param health_events_dataframe A data frame with predicted health events
#'        and relative 95% CI. Column names must be:
#'          - \code(date)  = date of the simulated day;
#'          - \code(event) = type of event (e.g. mortality for all causes,
#'                           hospitalizations for cardiac events, ...);
#'          - \code(lower) = lower bound of 95% CI of average daily number
#'                           of considered health event;
#'          - \code(fit)   = average daily number of considered health
#'                           event;
#'          - \code(upper) = upper bound of 95% CI of average daily number
#'                           of considered health event.
#'
#'
#' @return a data frame with n_days*2 rows (where n_days is the number of
#'         simulated days) and 8 columns. For each days, there are two rows
#'         in the data frame: one for hospitalizations for cardiac diseases
#'         and one for hospitalizations for respiratory diseases. The
#'         columns contain respectively: date of the date of the
#'         simulated day, the health outcomes, the 95% CI lower bound of the
#'         predicted average daily number of events, the predicted average
#'         daily number of events and the the 95% CI upper bound of the
#'         predicted average daily number of events, the 95% CI lower bound
#'         of costs associated to a particular health events, the average
#'         daily costs associated to a particular health event and the 95%
#'         CI upper bound of costs associated to a particular health events.
