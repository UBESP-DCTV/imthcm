#' Test dataset for health input.
#'
#' A dataset containing simulated historical information on daily average number
#' of health events. Number of deaths for all causes, cardiac diseases,
#' respiratory diseases and cerebrovascular diseases are the mortality events
#' considered. Number of hospitalizations for cardiac diseases, respiratory
#' diseases and cerebrovascular diseases are the hospitalization events
#' considered.
