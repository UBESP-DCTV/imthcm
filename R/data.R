#' Default italian-trained models.
#'
#' Defaul models are GAM models trained on the italian data used for EpiAir2
#' study (@source \url{http://www.epiair.it/}). In particular, GAM models
#' were trained on data belonging to Venice city. This dataset contains
#' information on health events and climate of the city of Venice in the
#' period from 2006-01-01 to 2009-12-31.
#'
#' Three different type of GAM models were trained:
#'
#' \enumerate{
#'   \item One model for the summer period, which was defined as the period
#'         that goes from 04-01 to 09-30.
#'
#'   \item One model for the non-summer period, which was defined as the
#'         period that goes from 01-01 to 03-31 and to 10-01 to 12-31.
#'
#'   \item One model for the all year.
#' }
#'
#' All the three models were implemented assuming a Poisson distribution for
#' health outcome, since the goal was to model health outcomes as count
#' events. A correction factor was applied to each model to take into
#' account overdispersion, i.e. the possibility that each outcome could
#' occur an high number of times for some days.
#' For all the three models the following variables were considered as
#' covariates: the mean of daily PM2.5 concentration of the simulated day
#' and of the three previous days (lag 0-3), the year, the month, the day
#' and all the possible combinations of them, the daily average temperature
#' (Celsius), modeled with a penalized spline, and the daily average
#' barometric pressure (hPa), modeled with a penalized spline.
#' Among all the pollutants, only one was included in the model since the
#' correlation between air pollutants is known to be relevant. In this case,
#' one pollutant acts as proxy for the others by including the effect on
#' health outcomes caused by the variation of other pollutants.
#' The reason behind the choice of an additional model for the summer period
#' relies in the different effect that pollutants can have in different
#' period of the year. Indeed, O3 has a significant effect on health
#' outcomes only in the summer period. Thus, the mean of daily O3
#' concentration of the simulated day and of the three previous days
#' (lag 0-3) was included only in the summer model, while the non-summer
#' model takes into account only PM2. Finally, a third model that predict
#' the number of health outcomes for the all year was created as a
#' replacement for the summer model if O3 are not provided as inputs.

#' Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) costs.
#'
#' Costs for Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) and stroke were derived from the
#' report of the American Heart Association (1) (which reported data on
#' costs derived from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) of the
#' U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality), considering 2015 data.
#' Unitary costs (medical, indirect, and total) have been calculated by
#' dividing the projected number of CHD and strokes by the corresponding
#' projected costs (for 2015).
#'
#' Costs for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) were derived from
#' the paper of Fen et al (2). They were
#' represented only by medical costs and referred to the year 2010. Also
#' COPD costs reported in the paper were derived from the MEPS survey.
#' Cost estimates are based on an exchange rate EUR-USD of 1.233.
