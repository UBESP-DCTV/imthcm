# imthcm

## Introduction

**REMEDIO** stands for “**RE**generating mixed-use **MED** urban communities
congested by traffic through **I**nnovative low carbon mobility s**O**lutions”.

**REMEDIO** is funded by Interreg MED Program 2014-2020 through the European
Regional Developed Fund (ERDF) (<https://remedio.interreg-med.eu/>)

**REMEDIO** implements concrete actions to relieve traffic congestion in
middle-size Mediterranean cities where territorial institutions, supported by
research/technical partners, are involved as beneficiary partners.

**REMEDIO** is a testing project and is developed in 3 steps.

- First Territorial partners implement soft actions on low carbon mobility
  solutions (Sustanaible Urban Mobility Plans  in Treviso, Split and Loures,
  Bike sharing Network in Spit and Treviso; bicycle parking areas in Loures,
  bus rapid transit, multi modal public transport optimizations, green-taxiway,
  safety road infrastructure for bus stops in Thessaloniki).
  
- Second Scientific partners jointly implement an Integrated Modelling Tool to
  assess the present and future scenarios road performance in terms of energy
  and freight transport efficiency, noise impact, air pollution, **cost** &
  **health** effects.
  
- In the meanwhile, as third step, the city communities are engaged in testing
  an operational path towards a participatory governance such as “horizontal
  condominiums” or “road contracts” that should lead to higher environmental
  and mobility performances.

The goal of imthcm is to provide the **health** and **cost** modules for the
Integrated Modelling Tool of REMEDIO project.
