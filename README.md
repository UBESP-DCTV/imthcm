Introduction
------------

**REMEDIO** stands for “**RE**generating mixed-use **MED** urban communities congested by traffic through **I**nnovative low carbon mobility s**O**lutions”.

**REMEDIO** is funded by Interreg MED Program 2014-2020 through the European Regional Developed Fund (ERDF) (<https://remedio.interreg-med.eu/>)

**REMEDIO** implements concrete actions to relieve traffic congestion in middle-size Mediterranean cities where territorial institutions, supported by research/technical partners, are involved as beneficiary partners.

**REMEDIO** is a testing project and is developed in 3 steps.

-   First Territorial partners implement soft actions on low carbon mobility solutions (Sustanaible Urban Mobility Plans in Treviso, Split and Loures, Bike sharing Network in Spit and Treviso; bicycle parking areas in Loures, bus rapid transit, multi modal public transport optimizations, green-taxiway, safety road infrastructure for bus stops in Thessaloniki).

-   Second Scientific partners jointly implement an Integrated Modelling Tool to assess the present and future scenarios road performance in terms of energy and freight transport efficiency, noise impact, air pollution, **cost** & **health** effects.

-   In the meanwhile, as third step, the city communities are engaged in testing an operational path towards a participatory governance such as “horizontal condominiums” or “road contracts” that should lead to higher environmental and mobility performances.

The goal of imthcm is to provide the **health** and **cost** modules for the Integrated Modelling Tool of REMEDIO project.
