\title{Compute costs of related health events}
\usage{
compute_cost(health_events, costs = NULL, ..., use_meps = is.null(costs))
}
\arguments{
\item{health_events}{A data frame with predicted health events
and relative 95% CI. Column names must be:
  - `date`  = date of the simulated day;
  - `event` = type of event (e.g. mortality for all causes,
                   hospitalizations for cardiac events, ...);
  - `lower` = lower bound of 95% CI of average daily number
                   of considered health event;
  - `fit`   = average daily number of considered health
                   event;
  - `upper` = upper bound of 95% CI of average daily number
                   of considered health event.}

\item{costs}{A data frame with the related individual costs for events in
`health_events`. Column names must be:
  - `event`           = events name as they appear in
                             `health_event`;
  - `individual_cost` = individual costs for the related
                             events;
  - `currences`       = currences in which each cost is
                             expressed.}

\item{...}{Other possible options passed to the function}

\item{use_meps}{[lgl] (default = FALSE) use Medical Expenditure Panel
Survey (MEPS) of the U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and
Quality costs data on weather if the user cannot provide more
specific data.}
}
\value{
a data frame with `n_days` * `n` rows (where
        `n_days` is the number of simulated days, and `n` is
        the number of events for which a cost was provided), and 7
        columns:
          - `date` for which the record is referred,
          - `event` the event considered
          - `currences` the currences used for the cost
          - `lower_individual_cost` the 95% CI lower bound of the
            cost
          - `fit_individual_cost` the median cost
          - `upper_individual_cost` the 95% CI upper bound of the
            cost
}
\description{
This function computes the costs associated the cardiac and respiratory
hospitalizations. Individual available costs were associated to stroke
occurrence and Congenital Hearth Diseases (CHD) for cardiac events,
whereas they were associated to Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD).
}
\details{
The output of the function is a data frame. The data frame is composed
by simulated days: n rows and 6 columns. Each row gives the fitted
number, with relative 95% CI, of the considered health outcomes and
relavite costs. Each column represents respectively the date of the
simulated day, the health outcomes, the 95% CI lower bound of the
predicted average daily number of events, the predicted average daily
number of events and the the 95% CI upper bound of the predicted average
daily number of events, the 95% CI lower bound of costs associated to a
particular health events, the average daily costs associated to a
particular health event and the 95% CI upper bound of costs associated
to a particular health events.
