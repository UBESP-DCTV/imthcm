\usage{
train_event_models(health_events_history = NULL,
  weather_history = NULL, ..., use_ita = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{health_events_history}{A data frame with historical health events
data. At least one week for each month for at least one year (full
years are obviusly preferrend) are needed in order to take into
account seasonal trends. Colum names must be included in:
- mort_all     = daily number of death (any causes);
- mort_cardiac = daily number of death (cardiac causes only);
- mort_resp    = daily number of death
  (respiratory casues only);
- mort_cer     = daily number of death
  (cerebrovascular causes only);
- hosp_cardiac = daily number of hospitalization (cardiac
  causes only);
- hosp_resp    = daily number of hospitalization
  (respiratory casues only);
- hosp_cer     = daily number of hospitalization
  (cerebrovascular causes only);}

\item{weather_history}{[data frame] A data frame with weather historical
       data with number of rows equal to the lenght of
       \code{health_events_history} and at least the following column
       (with exactly the same column names):
       - date           = date expressed in the format 'yyyy-mm-dd';
       - temp_mean      = mean temperature of corresponding day
                          (Celsius);
       - press_bar_mean = mean pressure of corresponding day (hPascal);
       - pm10           = mean value of pm10 of corresponding day
                          (\eqn{\mu g/m^3});
       - pm25           = mean value of pm25 of corresponding day
                          (\eqn{\mu g/m^3});
       - no2            = mean value of no2  of corresponding day
                          (\eqn{\mu g/m^3}).

       If provided, by a column named \code{038h}, also information
       of O3 daily maximum concentration for the daily 8-hours
       moving-means will be used (only for summer period, i.e., from
       April, 1st, to September, 30th).}

\item{...}{Other possible options passed to the function}

\item{use_ita}{[lgl] (default = FALSE) use italian historical
data on weather if the user cannot provide more specific data.}
}
\value{
a list of three sets of gam models, one set with the summer model
        for each type of event provided in \code{health_events_history}
        (taking into account also information from O3), one set for the
        non-summer models (using only non-O3 pollutant information) and
        a set of full-year models which do not use information on O3
        (if not provided). Together all the model of the first two sets
        or the models of the third set are alternative \code{NULL}.
        Output is returned \code{invisible()}. See Details section for
        more informations.
}
\description{
This function trains models that estimate the average daily number of
events.
}
\details{
The output is a list of three lists, named \code{summer},
\code{non_summer} and \code{full_year}. The first two are used if
ozone data are provided. They refer to a specific set of models that
consider also the ozone in summer period and only other pollutants in the
rest of the year. The last set (i.e., list) refers to a model that is
used if any knowledge about ozone concentrations is provided.
